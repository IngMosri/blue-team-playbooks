# Zscaler False Positive Investigation – Suspicious Russian Domain

## Scenario Overview
A web security alert was triggered due to outbound traffic to a domain categorized as suspicious. The domain was geolocated to a foreign region and raised potential malware or C2 concerns.

## Detection Source
- Secure Web Gateway: Zscaler
- Alert Type: Suspicious web destination
- Policy Action: Logged and monitored

## Initial Triage
- Destination domain flagged: autofanatik[.]ru (sanitized)
- Geo-location indicated foreign hosting infrastructure.
- Alert volume was elevated for a single endpoint.

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Threat Intelligence Validation
- Checked domain reputation in VirusTotal and public threat intelligence feeds.
- No confirmed malicious indicators were found.

### 2. Traffic Pattern Analysis
- Traffic was identified as browser-generated background requests.
- No repetitive beaconing or malware-like periodicity detected.

### 3. Endpoint Health Validation
- Verified endpoint EDR status and antivirus health.
- No suspicious processes or persistence mechanisms detected.

### 4. User Validation
- The user confirmed accessing supplier-provided automotive merchandise content.
- A third-party security verification mechanism redirected the session to a foreign domain.
- The event was classified as a third-party redirect and not as direct user-initiated navigation.

## Findings
The event was classified as a **false positive** caused by automated browser background traffic. No security compromise was detected.

## Lessons Learned
- Foreign domains do not always indicate malicious activity.
- Threat intelligence correlation is required before escalation.
- Browser background processes can trigger proxy alerts.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- T1071: Application Layer Protocol
- T1046: Network Service Scanning (not confirmed)

## Recommendations
- Improve proxy alert correlation logic.
- Implement automated false positive tagging.
- Educate users about background browser network behavior.
