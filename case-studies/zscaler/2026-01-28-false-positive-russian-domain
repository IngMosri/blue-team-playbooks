# Incident Report: Zscaler False Positive Analysis - Russian Domain (IR-2026-009)

## Executive Summary
Investigation into a web traffic alert triggered on January 28, 2026, involving a connection attempt to a Russian Top-Level Domain (.ru). The Zscaler Web Gateway blocked the request based on automated reputation policies. Forensic analysis confirmed the domain belongs to a legitimate Content Delivery Network (CDN) utilized by regional business partners, leading to its classification as a False Positive.

## Incident Timeline (UTC)
* **10:15:** Security Gateway (Zscaler) blocked an outbound request to a `.ru` domain from a workstation in the Development VLAN.
* **10:30:** Initial triage initiated to determine if the connection was user-initiated or a result of automated malware beaconing.
* **11:00:** Reputation analysis and WHOIS data review performed. Domain identified as part of a legitimate regional infrastructure.
* **11:30:** Connectivity restored after implementing a targeted bypass rule in the Zscaler policy.
* **12:00:** Case closed and documented as a False Positive (FP).

## Technical Investigation
The alert was triggered by a strict "High-Risk TLD" policy within the Zscaler tenant. While the `.ru` extension is often associated with malicious infrastructure, the destination domain exhibited patterns consistent with administrative web traffic rather than Command and Control (C2) activity.

### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
| Indicator | Type | Context | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `example-cdn-node.ru` | Domain | Destination URL | **Clean (False Positive)** |
| `10.0.0.45` | IPv4 | Internal Workstation (Source) | **Clean** |

### Traffic Audit Log
| Timestamp | Action | Source IP | Destination | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 10:15:22 | Blocked | 10.0.0.45 | `example-cdn-node.ru` | High Risk Country/TLD |
| 11:35:10 | Allowed | 10.0.0.45 | `example-cdn-node.ru` | Policy Override/Whitelist |

## Response and Remediation
1. **Source Identification:** Verified that the traffic originated from a legitimate update process of a third-party software used by the regional team.
2. **Sandbox Analysis:** Ran the destination URL through an automated sandbox to confirm absence of malicious payloads or redirect chains.
3. **Policy Adjustment:** Created a specific URL Filtering rule to allow this domain for the necessary user groups, preventing future workflow interruptions.
4. **Monitoring:** Monitored the source workstation for 60 minutes post-restoration to ensure no secondary suspicious connections were attempted.

## Lessons Learned and Recommendations
* **Efficacy:** The Zscaler automated blocking functioned as expected, prioritizing a "Default Deny" stance on high-risk geographic locations.
* **Gap:** Lack of prior documentation for regional partner dependencies led to a 75-minute downtime for the affected user.
* **Strategy:** Recommend a proactive review of partner-required domains during the onboarding of regional vendors to refine the "Global Allow List".
