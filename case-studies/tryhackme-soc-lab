# TryHackMe Simulation Labs (Hands-on Practice)

## Overview
This directory contains documentation and incident reports derived from **TryHackMe (THM)** simulation environments. These labs are used as a controlled environment to practice real-time detection, triage, and mitigation techniques against common attack vectors.

The purpose of these documents is to demonstrate my ability to translate technical security events from a SOC dashboard into professional, actionable forensic reports.

## Skills Validated in these Labs
* **Traffic Analysis:** Monitoring HTTP response codes (200, 404, 403) to identify automated reconnaissance.
* **Threat Intelligence:** Correlating source IPs with reputation databases and geolocation data.
* **Incident Response:** Implementing defensive actions such as IP blacklisting, rate limiting, and WAF rule updates.
* **Standardized Reporting:** Applying the NIST Incident Response lifecycle and MITRE ATT&CK mapping to simulated threats.
